#### Topic and rationale:

For this project, we ask;

How environmentally-friendly and sustainable are electric vehicles in Australia if we continue to generate and consume electricity generated by fossil fuels?

To investigate this question, the project will be split into three areas of study;

### Past

1. Investigating and analysing trends based on historical/current data on;
   1. Electric vehicle uptake (nationally and by state)
   2. Electricity generation and consumption by fuel type (nationally and by state)
   3. Global crude oil prices

Has our past methods and reliance on generating electricity via fossil fuels limited our uptake of electric vehicles?

### Present

2. Determining whether there are identifiable correlations between;
   1. The number of electric vehicles in Australia
   2. Electricity generation and consumption
   3. Global crude oil prices

Can the uptake of electric vehicles in Australia be attributed to changes in how we generate our electricity and rising global crude oil prices?

### Future

3. Through Machine Learning forecast future performances and trends of;
   1. Electric vehicle uptake in Australia
   2. Electricity generation and consumption
   3. Global crude oil prices
